# Model Optimization Guide for Intel Classroom Assistant

## Current Performance Issues Identified

1. **Model loads on every server restart** - No model caching
2. **System prompts tokenized repeatedly** - Could be pre-computed
3. **Large context window usage** - Inefficient memory usage
4. **No batching for multiple requests** - Sequential processing only
5. **Memory leaks potential** - Limited garbage collection

## Optimization Strategies

### 1. Model Caching & Persistence
- Implement model caching to disk
- Use memory mapping for faster loading
- Pre-load tokenized system prompts

### 2. Context Management
- Implement sliding window context
- Compress conversation history
- Use KV-cache optimization

### 3. Inference Optimization
- Enable batched inference
- Use dynamic batching
- Implement request queuing

### 4. Memory Management
- Implement proper model unloading
- Use gradient checkpointing
- Monitor memory usage patterns

### 5. Hardware Acceleration
- Optimize for Intel CPU features
- Use Intel Extension for PyTorch
- Enable multi-threading

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Impact, Low Effort**: Model caching, context truncation
2. **High Impact, Medium Effort**: Batched inference, memory optimization
3. **Medium Impact, High Effort**: Custom model fine-tuning, advanced caching

## Specific Code Improvements

### Current Issues in server.py:
- Line 134-147: Model loads synchronously on startup
- Line 355-370: No request batching
- Line 390-410: Context concatenation inefficient
- Memory management could be improved

### Recommended Changes:
1. Implement async model loading
2. Add request queuing system
3. Optimize context management
4. Add model warming strategies
