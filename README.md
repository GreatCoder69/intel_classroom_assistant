## Setup

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+, Node.js 18+
- Microphone (for speech features)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd intel_classroom_assistant
   ```

2. **Backend Setup**:
   ```bash
   # Create and activate virtual environment (recommended)
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # Install dependencies
   pip install flask flask-cors vosk sounddevice transformers psutil optimum[openvino]
   
   # Download Vosk speech recognition model
   curl -LO https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models/vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15.zip
   unzip vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15.zip
   
   # Start the backend server
   python server.py
   ```

3. **Frontend Setup**:
   ```bash
   cd classroom-assistant
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Access the Application**:
   - Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser
   - Backend API runs on `http://localhost:8000`


## Usage

1. Start the backend server (see Setup above)
2. Start the frontend (`npm run dev` in `frontend`)
3. Login with demo credentials:
   - Student: `student` / `student`
   - Teacher: `teacher` / `teacher`
4. Use the sidebar to access Dashboard, Subjects, AI Assistant, Schedule, and Settings

## For Developers

- All utility scripts and experimental code are now in `dev_utils/` or `archive/` (if present)
- Only keep `vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15` if you use voice features
- All function docstrings follow this format:
  """

  Args:
      ...
  Returns:
      ...
  """

   python performance_monitor.py
   ```

4. **Compare performance** (run both servers):
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Original server
   python server.py
   
   # Terminal 2: Optimized server (on port 8001)
   python server_optimized.py
   
   # Terminal 3: Run comparison
   python compare_performance.py
   ```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Customize optimization settings in `config.ini`:

```ini
[optimization_profiles.balanced]  # Recommended for most systems
max_context_length = 1024
batch_size = 2
memory_threshold_percent = 75.0
max_new_tokens = 256

[optimization_profiles.speed_optimized]  # For faster responses
max_context_length = 512
batch_size = 1
max_new_tokens = 128
```
