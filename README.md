## Setup

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+, Node.js 18+
- Microphone (for speech features)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd intel_classroom_assistant
   ```

2. **Backend Setup**:
   ```bash
   # Create and activate virtual environment (recommended)
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # Install dependencies
   pip install flask flask-cors vosk sounddevice transformers psutil optimum[openvino]
   
   # Download Vosk speech recognition model
   curl -LO https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models/vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15.zip
   unzip vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15.zip
   
   # Start the backend server
   python server.py
   ```

3. **Frontend Setup**:
   ```bash
   cd classroom-assistant
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Access the Application**:
   - Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser
   - Backend API runs on `http://localhost:8000`

## Usage Guide

### Getting Started
1. **Launch Services**: Start both backend server (`python server.py`) and frontend (`npm run dev`)
2. **Login**: Access the application and use demo credentials:
   - **Student Access**: Username `student`, Password `student`
   - **Teacher Access**: Username `teacher`, Password `teacher`
3. **Navigate**: Use the sidebar to access different features:
   - **Dashboard**: Overview of activities and schedule
   - **Subjects**: Browse available subjects with progress tracking
   - **AI Assistant**: Interactive chat with voice/text input
   - **Schedule**: View and manage class timetables
   - **Settings**: Configure preferences and system options

### Using the AI Assistant
- **Text Input**: Type questions directly in the chat interface
- **Voice Input**: Click the microphone button and speak your question
- **Educational Topics**: Ask about mathematics, science, history, literature, computer science
- **Role-Specific Responses**: Receive answers tailored to your role (student/teacher)
