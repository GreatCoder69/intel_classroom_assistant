# Archive

This folder contains old, unused, or experimental scripts and files that are not required for production or main development.

- Move any scripts or files here that are not actively used but may be useful for reference.
- This helps keep the main project directory clean and focused.

## Example Contents
- Old test scripts
- Deprecated utilities
- Experimental notebooks

If you need to restore or review any archived file, simply move it back to the main directory or dev_utils/ as needed.
